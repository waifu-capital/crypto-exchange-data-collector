### Fixed: Polars API Compatibility

**Files changed:** `src/main.rs` (lines 256-259)

**Problem:** Code failed to compile due to Polars API changes. `Series::new` now requires `PlSmallStr` instead of `&str`, and `DataFrame::new` expects `Column` instead of `Series`.

**Solution:** Added `.into()` calls to convert types:
```rust
// Before
Series::new("timestamp", data)

// After
Series::new("timestamp".into(), data).into()
```

### Fixed: Deprecated AWS SDK BehaviorVersion

**Files changed:** `src/main.rs` (line 47)

**Problem:** `BehaviorVersion::v2024_03_28()` was deprecated.

**Solution:** Updated to current version `BehaviorVersion::v2026_01_12()`.

### Improved: Data Loss Window Reduction (Problem #1 from PLAN.md)

**Files changed:** `src/main.rs` (lines 61-64, 109-110)

**Problem:** If the process crashes between WebSocket receipt and batch commit, all buffered data in the channel is lost. The channel buffer (100 messages) is entirely in-memory, and the batch interval was 60 seconds by default.

**Rationale:** This is a critical issue for a data collection system. While we accept that some data loss is possible on crash, minimizing the window is important for data integrity.

**Solution:**

1. **Enabled SQLite WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode:**
   ```rust
   conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL", []).unwrap();
   ```

   Benefits:
   - Writes go to a separate WAL file before being checkpointed to main database
   - Better crash recovery - uncommitted transactions can be recovered from WAL
   - Improved concurrent read/write performance
   - Readers don't block writers and vice versa

2. **Reduced default batch interval from 60 seconds to 5 seconds:**
   ```rust
   let batch_interval = env::var("BATCH_INTERVAL")
       .unwrap_or("5".to_string())
       .parse::<u64>()
       .unwrap_or(5);
   ```

   Benefits:
   - Maximum data loss window reduced from ~60 seconds to ~5 seconds
   - At 10 messages/second, worst case loss reduced from ~600 messages to ~50 messages
   - Still configurable via `BATCH_INTERVAL` environment variable for tuning

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more frequent disk I/O (every 5s instead of 60s)
- WAL mode uses slightly more disk space (WAL file + main DB)
- These trade-offs are negligible for the throughput level of this application

**Impact:** Worst-case data loss on crash reduced from ~70 seconds worth of data to ~15 seconds worth of data (batch interval + in-flight channel messages).
